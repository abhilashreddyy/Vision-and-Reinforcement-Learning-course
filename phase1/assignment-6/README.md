# EVA-2-Assignment-6
- This assignment have 2 parts
  - __Assignment 6-A__ : This assignment is about training CIFAR data on 10 classes by removig dense Layer and adding regularization to an existing model
  - __Assignment 6-B__ : About Implementing Different Types of convolutions
    - Normal Convolution
    - Spatially Separable Convolution (Conv2d(x, (3,1)) followed by Conv2D(x,(3,1))
    - Depthwise Separable Convolution
    - Grouped Convolution (3x3 and 5x5)
    - Grouped Convolution (one with 3x3,dilation = 1 and another with dilation = 2)
